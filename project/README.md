# FoodInspection Web Service Project

This project is a web service that will take input JSON data as a POST request and store the data an database. In addition, the web service will handle GET requests to return information that is generated by querying the database. 


## Python packages
 - bottle
 - pyscopg2-binary (or just pyscopg2) 

## Running the code

### DB initialization
To reset your database simply run drop and create.

### Server
To run the server simply run `python3 server.py` in the server directory. There are a series of configuration parameters that can be passed to the server, to see them run `python3 server.py --help`. The server by default will run on localhost and port 30235. After running the server you should be able to visit http://localhost:30235/hello and see a message "Hello, World!" to verify that your web service is running.  Alternatively, you can test using command line tool curl, eg `curl http://localhost:30235/hello`, if curl is installed. Note that you will need to get your database connection information working to start, which involves creating a server.conf file that follows the format in server.conf.example. 

### Client
While the server is running you run the client application in another terminal. To run the client that loads inspection data use something like `python3.py loader.py --file ../data/reallySmall.json`.
